    <p>
    A Fist Full of Fives is an exciting and dramatic 10-min orchestral concert opener using the same line-up as Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Everything in the piece derives from the number 5 in some way!
    </p>
    <p>
    â€‹Performed originally by the Corinthian Orchestra, it was subsequently performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Seal on BBC Radio 3.
