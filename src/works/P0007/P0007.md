    <p>
        Coram Boy was my first theatre score. My writing career up until 2005 had been largely in other areas: TV and some film. In 2003 Tom Morris, the artistic director of the Battersea Arts Centre, called to involve me in a scratch project called <i>Newsnight: The Opera</i>, in which I was one of four composers commissioned to set verbatim news transcripts to music.
    </p>
    <p>Tom loved what I did, and when he later moved to the National Theatre as an associate director, he invited me to submit a pitch for a new play; an adaptation of Jamila Gavin's novel <i>Coram Boy</i>.</p>
    <p>The central character in the story is Alex, a boy who wishes to pursue a career in music much against the wishes of his aristocratic land-owning family. The composer Handel is an aspirational figure for him, and Handel is a character in the play. The score for the show draws on materials from Handel's works, in particular the opera <i>Theodora</i> and <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
    <p>As my first experience of writing for theatre, this project was a real eye-opener for me. It was the first time I had experienced being part of a truly collaborative process.. one in which experimentation without fear of judgement was the norm. </p>
