        <i>Arpeggiare Variations</i> was commissioned by the violinist <a href="https://www.fenellahumphreys.com/"></a> Fenella Humphreys</a> as part of her <i>Bach2TheFuture</i> project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fenella was frustrated by a lack of solo works to perform alongside the Bach unaccompanied sonatas and partitas. A Kickstarter and remarkable fundraising drive ensued, and mine was one of six new works she was able to commission for the project.. the others by Sally Beamish, Cheryl Frances-Hoad, Gordon Crosse, Piers Hellawell and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The new works were recorded by Fenella across two critically acclaimed discs for Champs Hill Records.  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6bcwQbo1X5F6ee2ExFQJ6u?si=J0GPWOT-Rm243Y9_f_6Pxw">The second of these releases</a> , which opens with <i>Arpeggiare Variations</i>, received BBC Music Magazine's 2018 Instrumental Award. </p>

        <i>"It’s not often that you can say that a commission, or set of commissions, fills a genuine hole in the repertoire. However, that’s precisely what Fenella Humphreys has bestowed upon the musical world with ‘Bach 2 the Future"</i> - Gramophone Magazine Editor’s Choice
