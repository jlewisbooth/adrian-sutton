    <p>
    Agatha Christie's most celebrated detective novel comes alive in style in this production, directed by Jonathan Church and with gorgeous design by Rob Jones.
    </p>
    <p>The choice of musical language of this seemed clear to me from the very beginning; it's 1930s glamour. The Art Deco opulence of the interior of the famous Orient Express was a stylistic guide for Rob's work, and in parallel the music takes its cue from the dramatic film noir scores of the 30s and 40s.</p>
    <p><i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> was a project right on my patch in fact, since I adore orchestral music from that period. It has such a sweep and grandeur about it. </p>
