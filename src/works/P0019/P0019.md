        Adrian's first BBC Proms commission, <i>Some See Us</i>, was given its world premiere at the 2014 Proms, and is a setting of a powerfully-evocative text by Jon James on the subject of the lost voices of young men killed in war.

    <p>
        Unusually (and appropriately for the subject matter of the piece), the piece is scored for cambiata singers; cambiata is the restricted vocal range that boys adopt when transiting from a treble to an adult baritone.
