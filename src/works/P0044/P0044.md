    A new play by Steven Brown with Mark Rylance, <i>Dr. Semmelweis</i> is based on the story of the 19th-century obstetrician working in the Vienna General Hospital, who was the first person to recognise that handwashing was essential to prevent the spread of disease in hospitals.

        The score is for string quartet (un-miked) and was a refreshing change from studio production work!

        We were lucky to have the amazing <a href="https://www.salomequartet.com/">Salomé Quartet</a> as our performers (and they took part on stage as characters in the story).
