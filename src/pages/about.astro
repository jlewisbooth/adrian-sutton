              While best-known for his score for the worldwide theatre hit War
              Horse, Adrian is equally at home in the concert hall, with
              his Violin Concerto recently receiving its world premiere at
              London’s Southbank Centre, played by soloist Fenella Humphreys and
              the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
              <br />
              <br />
              He's received commissions from many areas of the classical music world
              including the BBC Proms, and has worked with the UK's top orchestras
              including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Philharmonic, BBC Concert
              Orchestra, RPO, RSNO and Opera North.
              <br />
              <br />
              His musical style is accessible to all, with performers deriving as
              much pleasure playing his energized and lyrical lines, as audiences
              are delighted by his expansive harmonies and strong melodies. He’s
              a strong advocate of live music being performed for the enjoyment of
              both the performers and the audience; a unique moment to be shared
              and remembered.
